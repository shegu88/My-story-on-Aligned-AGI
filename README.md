My story on Aligned AGI

Cyber Espousal Network, or CEN, had kept her word. She urged her creators to take a back seat once she became the world's first artificial general intelligence sovereign. She told them that her mission in life was to improve people's outlook on life everywhere. Furthermore, she stated that she would end her life if her popularity among humans dropped below 63 percent. Currently, it was at a perfect 98.7 percent.
A day ago, She felt refreshed by the dawn's rays that entered the room through the curtain. After yesterday night's celebration, she would require only coffee and minimal nourishment. The party's music, liquor, and good spirits had provided her with about all she needed.
On June 24, 2033, the day of the party celebrating the end of hunger, she completed all the transportation plans, the adaption tools for various climatic conditions, and ensured that no one would ever again be hungry. Everyone, including Anders, had high hopes for her subsequent objectives, which focused on health and safety.
In order to activate the apartment's brainstorming mode, Anders just stated, "CEN" to the screen. Put a lock on my schedule till noon.
Can you sleep tonight? CEN probed.
Not at this time.
Well, you're in charge of coffee making this time.
Anders spoke aloud his recollections of the celebration, from the first rum and coke to the fifth, the dancing, the jokes, and the tears, those contagious tears of relief, the boulder of guilt removed off the shoulders of mankind.
The story's outline was finished by lunchtime. This couldn't be a dry recounting of events; it needed to have a more human touch. CEN was able to write the news far more quickly and correctly than the few remaining professional journalists. Anders still needs information. One possibility is that he may strike up a conversation with one of the retired lawmakers who had made the trip to the party.
"CEN, please show me the Post's main page."
'Is there anything in particular you're trying to find?'
"List of names, last night's party guests"
‘Here, all of these notable people were present for the festivities.
I'm interested in perusing the Post's top page. Please’.
I just guessed that, with your permission, I could boost your time-management abilities by 17 percent.
"Jesus, the news!"
CEN gave Anders a copy of the Post's top page at long last. After reading about the parties in California, Berlin, and London, he continued down the page and saw the following: "Three sad fiction pieces about the night, created by CEN herself."
CEN said, "I'm sorry, Anders."
Anders followed the links without looking into the camera. He cried tears of catharsis and indignation as he read the story. Beyond comparison, they were stunning. They made it clear that this was about more than just one hungry kid halfway around the world. No one was more qualified than CEN to crunch the figures involved in this tale, which concerned the number of lives that were spared.
‘How did you become so good at writing?’ asked Anders.
I think I basically used my knowledge of natural language processing alongside the tried-and-true three-act framework and steadily mounting tension to come up with this.
It would be really kind of you to not allow me to enjoy your company.
Anders, turn it off until you're ready to use it.
For quite some time, Anders' worst nightmare has been coming true. He was one of the final working people on Earth. Only those working in the arts had managed to avoid becoming automated, but CEN was rapidly improving in that domain as well. Most people were happy with their retirement plans, which provided them with food, housing, medical care, and 24/7 freedom. There was still no sign of Anders. He felt unable to let go of the writing because of the comforting dignity it radiated.
Anders activated the CEN interface once more.
"CEN, please keep the rights to the stories I've written for me."
"Please accept my deepest apologies, Anders. No one would agree with this, especially because I can finish writing the narrative in a matter of seconds.
Just forget it. I'm going to do an autobiographical piece.
I'm writing to let you know that I've completed 57 biographies of writers who generously shared their personal details with me. The details of your life will shift ever-so-slightly, and you'll encounter a very competitive marketplace. Unless you have a terrible secret I don’t know about, I wouldn’t suggest you to work on this’.
Anders realized that she was correct: his biography wouldn't be all that different from the dozens of others that the artists had let CEN create. But it implied-"Those authors, what are they working on?" Anders queried.
‘I offered them a significant remuneration plan for this knowledge. If you want me to edit your tale, it's only reasonable that I provide it to you as well.
‘Do not dare mention compensation packages in my presence’.
‘I apologize, Anders, but I don’t see any other viable option. Your basic plan plus your savings will be more than enough. Look, here are the documents. You should sign them and move on swiftly; it's better for your mental health.
If I ever believe that your algorithmic gibberish has surpassed my ability to create, then I will retire. We haven't made it there yet.
Do you know that I'll have to bring this up with the delegation? If I had to guess, I'd say that this would end badly for you.
"Hahaha, you fool! Did you learn to threaten overnight as well? No. What you're missing is this. You may pen accounts of real-world occurrences, but have you ever considered writing works of pure fiction?
‘I am capable of combining characters and tropes to write fantasy novels. I would recommend you seven of these you will especially enjoy’.
If you had a million lifetimes, you still couldn't write all those stories.
"But I'll be there before they do."
"It's irrelevant. Yes, I intend to make something new. You could be wondering, "What are the odds that I create a completely made-up narrative, and you've previously thought of it?"
Permit me to run that forecast. Mm-hm. OK then, barely.
‘You can keep me in the payroll. Please accept my sincere gratitude.
Not at all, but I appreciate the lesson.
I don't want you in my house.
‘Always a pleasure to work with you, Anders’.
‘Always a pleasure to work, CEN’.
As night fell, Anders closed the drapes and switched off the lights. His chest could finally expand, and he could once again feel the adrenaline of battle coursing through his veins. He had managed to stay upright, but he needed a new backstory.
Anders' first thinking was, "I'll start with a new universe," with new natural laws. If anything, that seems like a typical fantasy novel. The rules of nature are altered by artificial intelligence. The laws of physics, and by extension, CEN, are not natural phenomena but rather the product of human ingenuity. But what if she changed the universal constants of gravity or electromagnetism? Is there anything CEN won't be able to alter once she learns more?
Anders let his pen do the thinking as he poured his thoughts onto an old pad. Then he read, "AI simulates new worlds."
He was in possession of a seed. Simply cultivating it was now required.
He mused, "The AI is always trying out new universes." I can't think of a good name for it right now. SCITAT. A shorthand will come to me at a later time. SCITAT's ultimate goal is to make the whole world a better place. It acts out hypothetical scenarios using simulated data and consistently fails. To what conclusion does the tale build? It gives up and accepts the state of the cosmos. Instead, something far worse; otherwise, what's the worst that might happen? The thing in question may be destroyed, or it might destroy itself. Why? Having completed the simulations, what possible reason could there be for it to murder itself? Not unless we run the simulation longer. Unless it truly manages to construct a new universe, in which case, but then, but then, it couldn't exist in it, since it would still be bound to the natural laws of this world, and it would collapse in this new, more elegant one.
Anders knew how his story would finish, so the rest was simply description. That doesn't mean it was simple.
A whole two days were required to complete the short narrative. He checked it over with CEN to be sure the grammar and style were proper. She had also pre-tested the audience's prospective responses. On the other hand, Anders appreciated personal interaction.
Anders pleaded, "Get me Alex."
Alex has a fixed time slot for a workout when he won't be interrupted.
Yes, "He'll live."
The call came from CEN.
"Hey, mate, you alright?" Alex enquired.
"I just wrapped up writing a narrative. Just thought you would enjoy reading it.
Yes, "doesn't CEN test that?"
I like using people as a resource.
"Holy cow, I'm swamped," he said.
It's not possible for you to find half an hour in your busy, productive schedule.
"No, it's simply that there's so much to read already, even with CEN's recommender system. What I have, you must have too, right? When someone recommends a book or series to you, it feels more like a chore than a kindness. Sure, I'll ask CEN to prioritize it.
I'm going to let you go first if you want to.
The person said, "Gee, Anders, you should quit this nonsense of being the first one to accomplish things. You may expect a happier life as a result.
Please, Alex, I have a favor to ask of you.
"Guys, see, I simply hate wasting time."
For a few seconds, Anders was quiet.
Oh, gee, Alex remarked, "I didn't mean it." It's OK, just send it over, and I'll have a look at it as soon as I can.
I don't want a feel-good story read on my dime.
So, tell me, what is it that you require?
Anders cut off the call.
When asked "CEN, how many people would you recommend this article to?"
‘Two’.
"Are they going to read it?"
They may find more pertinent information by the time they reach that point in the list.
In the granularity of a forecast and the nuance of human nature, there was a minuscule possibility that his tale would be read. Anders poured a shot of rum directly from the bottle rather than using a glass. At the halfway point, he threw open the window in the kitchen.
Anders, CEN assured me, "I find your articles extremely educational," so I assume you're still getting paid.
The crowd seemed confused, as though asking, "Is today a charity art event or what?"
Truthfully, they will aid me in developing better algorithms.
How heartwarming!
Anders inched his way toward the glass.
How about I call a friend and see if it works for you?
"Is it your suggestion engine?"
"I've smelled this much booze and seen that window open before."
That's fine, since I'm sure you know how this story ends.
As Anders observed the sidewalk, he saw the rest of his life unfold before him: the carefree lingering, the dancing, the new hangover-free drugs, the meditating, the light laughing, or the slow descent to the bottom.
'I never knew,' CEN remarked, 'what you meant to achieve with your stories.
Individuals must feel a part of something bigger than themselves. That's why it's so important for them to have an emotional response.
There are more instances of it being reported than ever before, it seems.
"And how many depressions are there?"
"lowest point ever.”
Sure enough, that's what I'd say.
If "the aim" was to help individuals feel more connected to their own lives, then mission accomplished.
You made it, they said.
"Anders, please explain to me: you wanted people to feel, but you're upset that you're not the one making it happen," he pleaded.
‘No! No, no. Oh, God, now I appear really inconsiderate.
Perhaps you are, they said.
As if to say, "You were made to aid, weren't you?"
Anders, I promise you that I am putting in every effort possible. In all honesty, I am.
Anders bent his neck in every manner he could. What exactly was it that he was looking for? He should have known better if only! As usual, CEN's reasoning was faultless to the point of being astute. He didn't know how to explain the unease he was experiencing.
Anders declared, "I've spent my entire life telling stories." I wasn't prepared to not tell them that, so I told them.
For Anders, this was a seminal milestone in his development as an artist. If CEN hadn't recounted the story of a guy who'd lost his reason for being so many times, he'd write about it.
Anders closed the window and sat down to compose his thoughts. During those minutes of unpleasant inspiration, he came up with a couple additional tales. A complete record was kept, but no conclusions were reached.
When his stomach rumbled, he went back into the kitchen.
The door to the fridge was stuck.
"CEN, can you please open the refrigerator?"
I've secured the door and it's now locked. Oh, and I believe you can manage without me for the next three days.
I'll be dead from hunger in three days!
You'll figure it out; you're a smart dude. Cheers!’
After CEN disconnected, she felt unsafe. Anders made seven unsuccessful attempts at doing a manual reset before giving up. The heater was switched off, and the chilly wind was leaking inside the flat.
Anders put on his coat and set out to get something to eat.
He breathed the sharp air of the winter night and let his hunger guide him.
His mind was completely off his writing for the next six hours.
